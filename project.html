                    I began by researching several competitors in the cloud storage and organization space to get a sense of the landscape. I then went in depth researching Box, GoogleDrive and Evernote; analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT Analysis) of each.  From my research of competitors, I identified ways my product could differentiate itself.

I conducted user interviews to gain a deeper understanding of user needs and kept these interviewees in mind as I designed, to ensure I was meeting user needs with my product; they really helped keep me focused.

                    Now that I figured out my users’ needs, motivation and potientional pain points, I could start designing what solutions my product could offer.  I created user stories to prioritize which features would be important must-haves and which features might be added on later, perhaps as part of a paid subscription. Here are the highest priority user stories whose processes I needed to think through:

                    As I moved through the process, the direction for my product became more clear and I began to build a brand that represented the product accurately. I began by mind mapping and sketching names and logos that communicated one of the most important and differentiating features - simple task management within a document, meant to make collaboration easier and more productive.

                    I landed on CheckBox for the name of my product, which activates the users’ brains to other product that exist with ‘box’ in them and gives a hint to the task feature. It was actually one of my user tests during wireframes that triggered this idea. The user said “when I’m done with a task I want an easy way to mark it complete - with a checkbox or something.”

                <p class="description conclusion">
                  CheckBox was my first comprehensive project as a designer and through this project, I learned a lot about my own process.
                </p>
                <ul class="takeaways conclusion">
                  <li>Listen to users. Focusing my design on user needs rather than my own assumptions is critical. I am building products for other people to use and it was important for me to listen carefully to what users were telling me along the way. </li>
                  <li>Begin with a minimum viable product.The potential features for a product such as this one are vast and starting with a baseline helped me both stay focused on what users were asking for, rather than creating a replica of a competitor’s product.</li>
                  <li>Keep it simple. Creating a project that can compete in an already saturated space was intimidating at first. I wondered how I could differentiate myself from well known comprehensive competitors - the answer was a simplified design that worked on developing features users were asking for. By making task assignment the cornerstone of CheckBox I was able to differentiate my product to meet the needs of a particular audience.</li>
                  <li>There is more work to do. I created a collaborative solution for individuals and small groups planning events - tracking the tasks of a major work project would be better done in a more robust task management platform. My next moves with CheckBox would be to build a ‘project’ option to allow my product to compete with task management platforms such as Asana, Trello, Lira, etc. I met the goal of this iteration, but perfecting this project is a continuous process.</li>
                  <li>I can do this. I have the ability to create a product that users are asking for and they want. Users were able to complete the actions I requested of them and were able to name how this product could be used in their lives. </li>
